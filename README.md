## Script commands overview
This manual summarizes script functions available in SimWorks' products. The SimWorks provides the built-in powerful script language that allows users to control each step of simulations, pre-/post-process the data, and define custom functions.

## Basic Syntax
The basic syntax includes:
- [Script Variables](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_script-variables): definitions of script variables and usage instructions, including the creation of numbers, strings, structs, datasets, etc., and related commands;
- [Data Input and Output](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_data-input-and-output): script initialization, saving, importing, and exporting data.
- [Program Control Flow](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_program-control-flow): functions used to implement flow control structures such as branch structure and loop structure;
- [Basic Operations](/localost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_basic-operations): including various operations on variables and files such as querying the type and members of a variable, and switching workpath;
- [Functions](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_functions): use and description of user functions, as well as the introductions of the functions for far field analysis and chromaticity analysis;
- [Basic Maths](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_basic-maths): elementary functions including trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential and power functions, and basic mathematical operations such as calculating absolute value, getting real part or imaginary part;
- [Advanced Maths](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_advanced-maths): functions used for advanced calculations such as differential and integral calculation, Fourier analysis, and interpolation;
- [Matrix Calculations](/localhhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_matrix-calculations): including functions for basic matrix operations and solving matrix equations. 


## Getting Data
Functions for [Getting Data](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_getting-data) include:
- Querying data-getting commands: list all the names of the results that the specific object has;
- Checking whether the selected object has desirable data;
- Getting property value from the solver, source, etc.;
- Getting results from sources, monitors or analysis groups.

## Setting Objects
Functions for [Setting Objects](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_setting-objects) are used to add, set and operate objects, as well as add and set materials: 
- Adding objects: add structures, sources, monitors, structure groups, analysis groups, etc.;
- Querying setting commands: return property lists for selected object;
- Set objects: set parameters for structures, sources, monitors, structure groups, analysis groups, etc.;
- Operate objects: perform operations on the selected objects, such as view conversion, pinning, hiding and deleting;
- Add and set materials: add desired materials, and set material parameters.

## Simulation
Functions for [Simulation](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_simulation) are mainly used to set parameters related to the simulation and control the running for specific project:
- Set simulation parameters;
- Control simulation: control the running of the specific project;
- Solve modes: solve modes in mode sources;
- Add customized meshes;
- Pre- and post-process functions such as the function controlling the running of the analysis group script.

## Data Visualization
Script commands for [Data Visualization](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_data-visualization) include:
- Different plot functions;
- Graphics Formatting commands.

## Miscellaneous
[Miscellaneous](/localhost/knowledge-base/Script-Commands_miscellaneous)ï¼Œinclude:
- Various operations in the workspace: In the script workspace, users can perform basic operations such as printing and drawing on existing variables through the GUI.
