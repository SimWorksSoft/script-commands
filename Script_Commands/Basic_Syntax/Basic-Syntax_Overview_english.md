# Basic Syntax Overview

The basic syntax part introduces the fundamental elements of the software script language such as data types, flow control structures, user-defined functions, and the details about the usage of the built-in mathematical and physical functions. 

## Script Variables

This section introduces the basic data types and operation rules. We provide various powerful data types and corresponding operations for users to process different kinds of data. Furthermore, some commonly-used mathematical and physical constants and special characters are predefined for convenient usage.
