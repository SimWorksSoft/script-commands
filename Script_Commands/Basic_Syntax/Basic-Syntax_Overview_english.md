# Basic Syntax Overview

The basic syntax includes:

- Variables: definition of script variables and usage instructions, including numbers, character strings, structs, etc.;
- Datasets: operation commands for datasets available in the software;
- Program control statements: including judgment, loop, etc.;
- Functions: use and description of user functions;
- Save, import, export: script initialization, saving, importing, and exporting data.

## Script Variables

This section introduces the basic data types and operation rules. We provides various powerful data types and corresponding operations for users to process different kinds of data. Furthermore, some commonly-used mathematical and physical constants and special characters are predefined for convenient usage.
